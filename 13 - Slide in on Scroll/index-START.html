      There's something so effortless about a classic trench and black
      accessories, especially for those unexpected summer showers. It's a
      practical, minimalist look we can get behind.

      The trench coat dates back to the First World War, when British and
      French army soldiers needed lighter, more durable outerwear on the front
      lines. Two legendary British fashion houses, Burberry and Aquascutum,
      have laid claim to its invention; the former developed the coat’s
      signature gabardine fabric in 1879. Despite its utilitarian beginnings,
      the trench, especially in Britain, has over decades morphed into a
      wardrobe staple and a signifier of chic style. Though it is the epitome
      of a timeless garment, the coat managed to make more than one standout
      street style cameo at London Fashion Week this season, looking wholly
      modern all the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trench was spotted on showgoers in a range of silhouettes, colors,
      and textures. There were oversize coats with big balloon sleeves, some
      made of red PVC, and others cut from minimal black leather. And yes,
      there was one classic Burberry trench, lined with the brand’s storied
      check pattern. This time however, it was worn with a mini and platform
      boots, not a pair of Wellies or military attire. That’s the magic of the
      trench: it can be dressed up or dressed down, and span any era.

    <h2><span>Backless Wonder</span></h2>
    <i class="content-dek">
      Is there a sexier statement than a little back interest? We think not.
      And this little slip is business in the front, party in the back.
      Vacation, here we come.

      Why it’s so must-try? Well, this is a pretty safe move on showing your
      skin to everyone, this is not something perverse or sultry and still, it
      looks sexy and incredibly enticing. Plus, you don’t have to show your
      boobs or bums, all you need is to give a try to a bare back. Do I have
      your attention now? If yes, then you better take a close-up look through
      my favorite street style.

      What happens when a cute, cropped sweater meets a great pair of
      boyfriend jeans? One perfect, stay-at-home summer look.
    </i>
    <p>
      When the cold weather creeps in and sweater season begins, there's no
      more flattering item to style up than a cropped jumper. Big knits can
      remove all sign of a waistline, so I'm always in favour of more shrunken
      styles. They also can be styled in more ways because of their shorter
      hemlines. The detail may sound small, but the impact for winter wardrobe
      could be big.
