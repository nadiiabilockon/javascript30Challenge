        Jeremy was eight years old when he met her, and even then, she was the
        most beautiful girl he’d ever seen. When his dad got a new job outside
        the city, Jeremy moved into a new house with his mom and dad. The house
        sat on the edge of a forest that reminded him of something he read in a
        storybook. The trees were unnaturally colorful, with deep greens, bright
        reds, and even a touch of blue. It was the kind of forest that seemed
        almost magical.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeremy, against his parents’ judgment, decided to explore one evening.
        When he tripped on a tree root and scuffed his knee, a little girl his
        age appeared from behind a tree.
      </p>

      />

      <p>
        She looked at him strangely with her dark eyes. Her hair fell to her
        shoulders in loose curls. He followed her gaze to the spot on his knee
        that was covered in blood. Concern was written on her face, but she said
        nothing. She backed up slowly and turned to walk away.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s okay,” Jeremy said. “It doesn’t really hurt that bad.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The girl stopped and turned toward him, her eyes wide. “Are you talking
        to… me?” she said with a soft voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeremy pushed himself off the ground and wiped the blood of his knee
        with his hand. “I didn’t see anybody else out here. Do you live around
        here?”
      </p>
      <p>
        She stepped toward him, her eyes taking on a calmer quality. Her mouth,
        which had before been wide open, formed into a smile. “Will you play
        with me?”
      </p>
      <p>
        And so began their friendship. Allie lived with her family in a small
        house in a clearing in the middle of the forest. She was an only child.
        That day, they chased each other around trees and Jeremy barely noticed
        that the leaves of the trees glowed in the darkness, giving light to
        their play.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though his mom was unhappy when he turned up at home well past dark, she
        smiled as he told her about his new friend and the fun they had
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        They played every day for two weeks until the evening he followed her to
        her house. It was an old but sturdy brick house.
      </p>
      <p>
        “My mommy and daddy say I’m not supposed to bring anybody here,” Allie
        said.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Why not?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I don’t know,” she said, her usual smile broken. “I tried to tell them
        that you’re my friend.” She looked at her front door. “They’re always
        sad.”
      </p>

      <img

      />

      <p>
        The door opened and a large man with a long beard of dark brown stepped
        out. At the sight of Jeremy, the man stopped. “Who are you?” He glanced
        out at the forest behind Jeremy. “What are you doing here?”
      </p>
      <p>“Daddy, this is my friend,” Allie said.</p>

      <p>
        Ignoring her, he stepped out into the yard, locking his gaze on Jeremy.
        A small woman with dark hair that matched the color of Allie’s stepped
        out behind him.
      </p>
      <p>“I’m J-J-Jeremy.” Jeremy took a step back and looked at Allie.</p>
      <p>“You have to go,” the man said. “You have to go now.”</p>
      <p>
        “I’m sorry,” Jeremy said. “Allie said I wasn’t supposed to come here.”
      </p>
      <p>The man looked at him, confused. “Allie…” he said.</p>
      <img
        src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/235734/pexels-photo-235734.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940"
      />

      <p>
        The man’s wife pulled him back toward the house. “Allie, come inside,”
        she said before turning her gaze to Jeremy. “Just go,” she whispered.
      </p>
      <p>
        He took one look at Allie, who had tears forming in the corners of her
        eyes, and ran as fast as his little legs would carry him.
      </p>
      <p>
        He didn’t see her again for eight years. It wasn’t that he didn’t go
        into the forest again. He did, but she never showed up again, and he
        wasn’t willing to go near her house after the encounter with her
        parents. One evening, when he was sixteen, he was sitting on the back
        porch, furiously typing away on a story he was working on for the school
        newspaper. He noticed movement in the forest, and his skin began to
        tingle.
      </p>
      <p>Allie? he thought.</p>
      <p>
        Laying his laptop down, he made his way to the tree line, which was
        blocked by a chain-link fence by this time. In the distance, he saw her.
        She was older, of course, but the sight of her had a much more profound
        effect on him than it did when he was eight years old. He hopped the
        fence and walked toward her. Her dark hair still framed her face in
        loose curls, and her face still lit up with the same smile he
        remembered.
      </p>
      <img

        class="right-img"
      />
      <p>“Hi, Jeremy,” she said. “I hoped you would see me.”</p>
      <p>
        He threw his arms around her and hugged her. “Where have you been? Why
        haven’t I seen you all this time?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’m sorry,” she said, holding him tight. “My parents can get pretty
        protective.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He let her go though he didn’t want to. “Your dad looked at me like I
        was a ghost that day.”
      </p>
      <p>
        She laughed. “You kinda were,” she said. “We don’t see many people.”
        “Why don’t I see you at school?” They started walking deeper into the
        forest. The leaves of the trees gave off their glow. “Every year I’ve
        looked, hoping I’d see you.” “I’m homeschooled,” she said. She stopped
        and looked at him. “What’s it like to go to school?”
      </p>
      <p>
        He spent the rest of the evening telling her about his classes, his
        favorite teacher Mr. Renier, who was encouraging him to be a journalist,
        his job on the school newspaper, and his best friend Asher, who he met
        because of a shared love of Christopher Nolan films when they were in
        sixth grade. She listened to him with rapt attention, hanging onto every
        detail.
      </p>
      <p>
        He told her about his dream to move to the city after high school to
        study journalism, and she seemed to love this detail the most. “I wish I
        could see the city,” she said. “It sounds so fascinating.” “Let’s go
        together,” Jeremy said. “I can drive us.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Her smile disappeared as she looked down at the ground. “I couldn’t do
        that,” she said. “My parents don’t even know I’m talking to you. They’d
        never let me go to the city.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though he hadn’t seen her in years, it felt like they’d never been
        apart. Yet somehow, it also seemed like something critical about their
        relationship was changing as he took her hand in his. “It’s okay,” he
        said. “We can just stay here.” Her smile returned. “I missed you.” “I
        never stopped looking for you.” She squeezed his hand. “Well, I’m here
        now.” For the next year, they saw each other intermittently though it
        wasn’t nearly as often as Jeremy would’ve liked. Allie didn’t talk about
        her parents, but he suspected they kept her inside most of the time. He
        felt sorry for her. She was like a bird, forbidden to use her wings to
        fly. He wondered why her parents were so controlling. When they were
        together, Jeremy spoke often of his dream to return to Sadia, the city
        where he’d spent the first eight years of his life. He asked her to go
        with him to the city several times, but she insisted she couldn’t.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several months before his eighteenth birthday, after they hadn’t seen
        each other for a while, they met at an outcropping they’d found on one
        of their earlier explorations. There was a bench where they often sat
        together, staring up at the stars. “Guess what,” she said, taking a seat
        next to him. Taking her hand, he scooted closer to her. “You’re finally
        going to go on a date with me to the city.” She laughed. “No, silly,”
        she said. “It’s my birthday.” His eyes met hers. “Why didn’t you tell
        me? I would’ve gotten you something.” He laughed. “I can’t believe after
        all this time, I’ve never known your birth date.” Allie smiled. “It’s
        okay. I guess I really don’t know yours either.” He told her. Not that
        it was important; just to be with her was enough of a gift for any day.
        He squeezed her hand. “So what shall we do for your birthday?” She
        stood. “There’s a place I want to show you.” Allie took him to a high
        hill he’d never been to before. As the sun began to set, he could make
        out the city with its bright lights and tall buildings in the distance.
        Nearing the edge of the hill, he realized Sadia Lake separated the
        forest from the city. He’d never realized the city was so close to home.
        The sight was breath-taking and he realized he was staring.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        “That’s exactly what I wanted for my birthday,” Allie said, interrupting
        his thoughts. Jeremy met her gaze. “What?” She was smiling. “That look
        on your face,” she said. “I know how much you love the city. When I
        found this place, I knew I had to bring you here.” She pulled close to
        him and laid her head on his shoulder. He kissed the top of her head,
        taking in the softness of her hair and the smell of her perfume. “It’s
        incredible,” he said. He held her tight as he looked out on the ripples
        of white from the moon and the city lights reflected on the water. It
        would only be a year before he went to the city, but looking at it now
        with Allie inspired a new hope in his mind. He took her hand in his. “I
        love you, Allie,” he said. It was the first time he’d said it. Her face
        lit up. “I love you too.” He wasn’t finished. “I can’t imagine going to
        the city next year without you.” She stepped back from him, a sudden
        look of concern on her face. “What are you saying?” He pulled close to
        her again, taking both of her hands in his. “I want to spend the rest of
        my life with you. Marry me. We’ll go to the city together.” She pulled
        her hands away. “I can’t, Jeremy.” He couldn’t believe it. “You just
        said you love me too.”
      </p>
      <p>“I do. More than you know.”</p>
      <p>“Then why?”</p>
      <p>
        She walked to the edge of the hill and he joined her. “I’m dying,” she
        said as she gazed out at the water. Her words cut him like a blade to
        the heart. She turned to him with a look of deep sadness in her eyes. “I
        don’t have much time left,” she said in a broken voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Why didn’t you tell me? How long have you known?” His heart felt like a
        pounding drum in his chest. “I didn’t want you to see me differently. I
        didn’t want our relationship to be defined by you wanting to fight for
        me.” He grabbed her and pulled her close. Tears filled his eyes as his
        body began to tremble. “There has to be a chance,” he said, his voice
        just as broken as hers. “I can’t let you die.” She pushed away from him
        and looked deeply into his eyes. For a moment she said nothing, as if
        she were searching for the right words. “My doctors say I won’t survive
        beyond my eighteenth birthday. There’s nothing they can do.” He didn’t
        know what to say. She had maybe a year left, and then she would be gone.
        He’d spent the best parts of the last decade just being with her. He
        couldn’t imagine life without her. “Don’t give up on your dream,
        Jeremy,” Allie said, her voice tinged with more conviction. “Not for me.
        Not for anybody.” She put her hand to his cheek. “Go to the city. Get
        married. Start a family. Be happy.” It was too much. He cleared his
        throat, fighting back the tears. “I just want you.” Allie’s face twisted
        as her confidence broke. “I’m so sorry.” She said it as if it were her
        fault. “I just want you to live.” They spent the rest of the night
        huddled together in silence, watching the city come alive in the
        darkness. The next several months passed quickly. Jeremy worried that
        he’d lose Allie any day, but she seemed certain that she’d survive until
        her eighteenth birthday, and then no longer. Several times he asked her
        to marry him anyway and move to the city. Senior year was coming to a
        close and he had until August before he would be leaving, which would be
        one month after her birthday. They could leave early, he told her, and
        move into an apartment in May. Though she loved the thought, she
        insisted it wouldn’t work and she didn’t want to bring that level of
        unhappiness to him when she finally passed.

      />
      <p>
        The day arrived, and Jeremy couldn’t make it to Allie fast enough. He
        ran through the forest, which was unusually lit up for the morning. He
        made it to her house, which was quiet. In ten years, he’d never been
        inside. He waited for her, expecting her to come out any minute. But
        minutes turned into an hour and he felt the weight that he was running
        out of time. It had been ten years since he encountered her parents, and
        the look on her dad’s face that day still haunted him. But he had to see
        her. He walked up to the front door and tentatively knocked on the door.
        No one answered. He tapped on the door with more force, but still
        nothing. “Allie!” He pounded on the door. “Please! I just need to see
        her!” The door opened, and her dad, older and with a deranged look on
        his face, peeked his head out. “Please,” the man said. “You can’t be
        here.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I just want to see Allie. I just need to know she’s okay.” “Allie’s not
        here,” the man replied. “Is it the boy?” he heard an older woman’s voice
        inside say.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Please just go,” the man said. “I don’t know how you think you know
        Allie, but that’s impossible.” Jeremy couldn’t make sense of the man’s
        words. Why was he acting like Allie didn’t know him? The man moved to
        close the door, and Jeremy, in desperation, pushed his way through. “I
        have to see her,” he said as he forced his way into the house. The man
        fell back and Allie’s mom stood still, afraid. Jeremy put his hands up.
        “I’m not here to hurt anybody,” he said. “I’m just worried about Allie.”
        The woman pointed a frail finger toward a bedroom behind Jeremy. “She’s
        in there.” Jeremy walked into the room, and the sight nearly broke him.
        Allie was on a bed, unconscious. Her skin was light, and her body was
        thinner than he’d ever seen it. A strange glowing blue light hovered
        next to her body. He approached her and took her hand. “Why is she like
        this?” The man and his wife stepped into the room. The man spoke first.
        “She’s always been like this.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeremy looked back at the man, confusion setting in. “What do you mean?”
        This time the woman spoke. “Our daughter’s been lying in that bed for
        the past eighteen years. Ever since she was born.” “That’s impossible.
        I’ve been with her hundreds of times.” The man pulled up an old rickety
        chair from the corner of the room and took a seat. He sighed before
        launching into the story that would change Jeremy’s life. “Before Allie
        was born,” the man began, “we were told by a mysterious man that she
        would be born with a broken heart. With someone else’s heart. Her heart
        would reside in someone who was meant to die so that she would give
        life.” He pointed to the blue light. “The forest lights are the only
        thing keeping her alive. The heart inside of her failed her long ago.
        The forest lights could only keep her alive until today.” The man’s chin
        dropped as he was clearly overcome with a hopelessness Jeremy was only
        beginning to know. “Why can’t she have a heart transplant?” he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Allie’s mom stepped forward and placed her hand on his shoulder. The
        gesture was surprisingly calming. “Allie’s heart isn’t like any normal
        heart,” she said. “The man told us her heart, the one that resides in
        someone else, is the only heart her body will accept. My husband and I
        would gladly give our hearts if it would save her.” Her voice fell
        quiet. “Our hearts won’t save her.” Jeremy stood. “She can’t die,” he
        said, indignant. “Someone out there has her heart. That’s not fair. How
        can you even know who has her heart?” The man and the woman looked at
        each other, a look of debate in their eyes. “How do we stop this?”
        Jeremy insisted.
      </p>
      <img

        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        The man cleared his throat. “The man who told us about the forest lights
        and about Allie’s heart told us that Allie’s spirit would know who her
        heart belonged to. He said that the person with her heart would see her
        spirit in the forest as if she were standing in front of them.” The
        truth slammed into him with enough force to cause him sit down again.
        “It’s me. Isn’t it?” He remembered the first time he saw her. The way
        she looked at him, as if he shouldn’t be able to see her. He remembered
        her touch, the way her lips felt when he kissed them. She’d been so
        real. “She knew,” he said. “Why didn’t she tell me?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’ve seen her at times,” her mother said. “Something about being her
        mom, I guess.” The woman smiled. “You’ve made her happy. She truly loves
        you.” Jeremy looked at Allie’s face, which looked so peaceful. He
        thought of his dreams of moving to the city. Thoughts that were quickly
        broken by Allie’s voice saying how much she wished she could go to the
        city. He imagined her walking through the streets of Sadia, pushing a
        stroller, being happy. It was her heart beating inside him. They were
        meant for each other, and yet they could never be together. He put his
        hand on his chest to feel the beat of Allie’s heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        He knew what he had to do. He bent down and kissed her cheek. “Thanks
        for giving me your heart, Allie,” he whispered. “Now it’s your turn.”
